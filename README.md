# Best-Friend App, your BFF when it comes to travelling

Search locations and it will show Restaurants, Attractions and Hotels near you. 
Make sure you allow geolocation so that your Friend can be with you wherever you go, 
you can filter. If you want to click the map cars on Google map,
clicked around the left-center of the image and it will scroll to the side details of that place with links to trip advisor and their website.
